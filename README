Senior C++ Dev / Code first Audition

The objective is to write a program that can resize an JPEG image
to a desired size. The size will be the larger dimension of the image.
It can only use libjpeg and STL libraries. Also there's the challenge
for the memory peak. It cannot exceed 30 MB, althought images can reach
up to +100 MB when fully loaded in memory.

As for an effect, I bundled the libjpeg with the code, to avoid version
problems and link problems. The executable won't need any additional
DLL or shared libraries.

The strategy is quite simple. It chuncks the original memory in smaller
pieces, and scan the image everytime to extract only one chunck per time.
There are commented lines to save the chuncked pieces. It really keeps the
peak memory low, althought a lot of I/O will happen. Surely, it spends more
time than just using full memory size. But that's not the point.

The project is using CodeBlocks, but it's pretty straightforward to use
a Makefile to build it. It's not using any special OS stuff, so it's pretty
much OS independent.

It's not the best code I've even written, but I tried to spend less than 24h
coding it. So I think it should be more commented and a little bit tweaked.

Contact me if you have any questions or considerations.
